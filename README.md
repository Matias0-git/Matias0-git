## 🚀 Projects & Explorations:

My future projects will focus on understanding the data lifecycle and building foundational components for future data-intensive systems. While these demos are from my broader development journey, I'm actively learning how to reframe them with a data engineering lens (e.g., how data flows, where it's stored, and how it could be used for analytics or ML).

Here are some of my existing projects, with video demonstrations available on my YouTube channel: [YouTube Channel Link](https://www.youtube.com/@MatiasMenaDaDalt-y2t)
